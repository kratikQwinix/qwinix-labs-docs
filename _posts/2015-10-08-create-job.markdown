## Cretea a Job

<hr>

Click on **Create jobs** to get started

<hr>

Enter the job name and select the Freestyle project

<hr>

Select **Git** under the Source code management options

<hr>

Build Triggers specify or trigger the build on a particular action or period of time.

Build after other projects are built
Build periodically

Jenkins can poll your Revision Control System for changes. You can specify how often Jenkins polls your revision control system using the same syntax as crontab on Unix/Linux.



<hr>

Add a Build-Step

Select **Execute shell** to do your build using a shell script

When a Jenkins job executes, it sets some environment variables that you may use in your shell script or batch command. The following table contains a list of all of these environment variables.
