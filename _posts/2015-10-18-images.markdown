A Docker image is made up of filesystems layered over each other. At the base is a boot filesystem, bootfs , which resembles the typical Linux/Unix boot filesystem. A Docker user will probably never interact with the boot filesystem. Indeed, when a container has booted, it is moved into memory, and the boot filesystem is unmounted to free up the RAM used by the initrd disk image.

Docker next layers a root filesystem, rootfs , on top of the boot filesystem. This
 rootfs can be one or more operating systems (e.g., a Debian or Ubuntu filesys-
tem).In Docker, the rootfs stays in read-only mode and Docker takes advantage of [union mount][un] to add more read-only filesystems on top of rootfs.

Docker calls each of these filesystems images. Images can be layered on top of
 one another. The image below is called the parent image and you can traverse
 each layer until you reach the bottom of the image stack where the final image
 is called the base image. Finally, when a container is launched from an image,
 Docker mounts a read-write filesystem on top of any layers below. This is where
 whatever processes we want our Docker container to run will execute.

#### 1.Listing Docker Images

{% highlight sh %}
$ sudo docker images
{% endhighlight %}
The command lists all the images in the local machine.

 </body></html>

#### 2.Pulling Docker Images from DOCKER-HUB

 Docker Images can also be pulled from [DOCKER_HUB][dh] registry.
 {% highlight sh %}
$ sudo docker pull ubuntu
{% endhighlight %}
This command pulls the **ubuntu** image from dockerhub

#### 3.Image tags 
Each image inside the repository is identified by what Docker calls **tags**. Each image is being listed by the tags applied to it, so, for example, **12.04** , **12.10** , **quantal** , or **precise** and so on. Each tag marks together a series of image layers that represent a specific image 
(e.g., the 12.04 tag collects together all the layers
of the **Ubuntu 12.04** image). This allows us to store more than one image inside a repository.

#### 4.Running the containers
{% highlight sh %}
$ sudo docker run -t -i --name new_container ubuntu /bin/bash
{% endhighlight %}

This command runs the container using ubuntu image and runs the command /bin/bash

 There are two types of repositories: **user repositories**, which contain images contributed by Docker users, and **top-level repositories**, which are controlled by the people behind Docker.

#### 5.Searching images
{% highlight sh %}
$ sudo docker search puppet
{% endhighlight %}
It’ll search images and return:
  
  * Repository names
  * Image descriptions
  * Stars - these measure the popularity of an image
  * Official - an image managed by the upstream developer (e.g., the fedora image managed by
  the Fedora team)       
  * Automated - an image built by the Docker Hub’s Automated Build process.

<hr>

#### 6.Pulling a particular image
{% highlight sh %}
$ sudo docker pull jamtur01/puppetmaster
{% endhighlight %}

Pulls jamtur01/puppetmaster image

<hr>

#### 7.Building Docker Images
We can create our own Docker images using two methods:

  * Via the **docker commit** command (**NOT Recommended**)
  * Via the **docker build** command with [Dockerfile][dfile]
